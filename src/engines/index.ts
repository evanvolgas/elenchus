 * Elenchus V3: Pure workflow gate architecture.
 *
 * The calling LLM IS Socrates. Elenchus provides:
 * - Persistence (SQLite storage)
 * - Coverage tracking (questions categorized by type)
 * - Workflow gates (block spec generation until requirements met)
 *
 * No more regex engines. No more fake intelligence.
 * The tool descriptions ARE the methodology.
 */

// This module intentionally exports nothing.
// All intelligence comes from the calling LLM.
// All infrastructure comes from the tools themselves.
